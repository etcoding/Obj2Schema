This libriary allows to take an object, and generate a CREATE TABLE Sql statement to store it.

It doesn't do any fancy mapping, and at this moment supports only types that can be directly stored to database, e.g. int, string, bool, enums.
There's no support for collections or inner complex objects yet. Also there's not support for foreign keys, indexes, filegroups, etc.

Right now libriary supports 3 databases: Sql Server, MySql, and Sqlite. Adding new ANSI SQL-compliant database should be very straightforward - 
just create a new map by inheriting from DbDataTypesMapBase or one of the predefined maps, and filling out the Maps and Expressions dictionaries.
Looking at one of the predefined maps should get you started in no time.

The library was created when I was making a Visual Studio extension, which was using Sqlite, and I needed a few tables to store some simple classes.
I guess i'm starting to get lazy, and prefer to write more code to do less - in this case have something to generate SQL schema for me.

For usage example see SampleUsage class in tests.

Anyhow, if you find it useful - great. If you'll have any ideas - drop me a line at evgeni at etcoding dot com.
